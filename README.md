# Invisible-Cloak-Using-OpenCV
This project implements an "invisible cloak" effect using OpenCV and Python. The concept involves capturing a background image and then replacing specific color regions (in this case, Blue) in the video feed with the captured background, creating an illusion of invisibility.
